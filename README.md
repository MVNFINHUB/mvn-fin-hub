MVNFinHub — Final "Alien" Theme (What you received)

Files included:
- index.html            (main landing with accessible hero slider)
- education.html        (education index & concept groups)
- style.css             (theme: "alien" dark / futuristic + responsive layout)
- script.js             (slider, theme toggle, mobile nav)
- /assets/images/MVNFinHub-logo.svg  (wordmark)
- /assets/images/MVNFinHub-mark.svg  (compact square mark)
- manifest.json (optional) — generate if you want PWA support
- /assets/favicons/* (recommended to generate PNG fallbacks)

Quick install & test:
1. Place all files in your site root (or in a subfolder preserving the paths above).
2. Serve locally to confirm (Python: `python -m http.server 8000`), open http://localhost:8000.
3. Verify header renders wordmark on desktop and compact mark on small screens, favicon visible, hero slider works (keyboard left/right, indicators), and theme toggle switches light/alien (persisted to localStorage).
4. Replace placeholder Unsplash images with your final hero images (use WebP for performance) and update OG image.
5. Generate PNG favicons from the compact SVG and add them to `/assets/favicons/` (16/32/180/192/512) and add links in the <head>.
6. Deploy (Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages).

If you want, I can:
- Generate PNG/WebP hero images and optimized favicons for you.
- Update all remaining pages (about, services, contact, concept pages) to match the theme (I provided education.html as example).
- Inline the logo SVG into your HTML for fewer requests and color control.
- Produce a tiny serverless contact endpoint to collect suggestions.

Tell me which of these next steps you'd like and I'll deliver them.
